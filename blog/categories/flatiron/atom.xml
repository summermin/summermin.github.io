    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the Flatiron School, we are surrounded by passionate people who are, of their own volition, here to learn and all more invested in our educations than at any other institution of learning I have ever attended. We all build each other up and have grand ideas of the kind of programmers we will be in a few years. Unfortunately, the bubble which we live in doesn&rsquo;t always extend to the rest of the world. And lest you or I think that the entire world of programming is all rainbows and niceties, I&rsquo;m here today to say &ldquo;no!&rdquo; For every good person you encounter, undoubtedly there is another who is trying to screw you for their own nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>Here we will cover two ways in which you can get royally nailed to the wall as well as some precautions you can take to avoid them. I should add a disclaimer that these are pretty amateur mistakes which are easily avoidable but hopefully this will help you better understand how they work rather than just knowing how to prevent them.</p>

<p>First is sql injections. Most applications, especially if they involve users and passwords will be backed up by a database to store all that information. With malicious sql injections, people can completely destroy your tables or steal users&#8217; passwords. It goes something like this.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def so_much_bunny
  sql = &lt;&lt;-SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM bunnies
    WHERE bunnies.name = "#{name}"
  SQL

  DB.execute(sql)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now if your name variable were set to, lets say &ldquo;Marvin&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s fine and dandy, you would get back a row matching the bunny Marvin. But a less than ethical programmer might set name = &ldquo; OR 1 &ndash; which would run sql code that looked something like this</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def so_much_bunny
  sql = &lt;&lt;-SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM bunnies
    WHERE bunnies.name = "" OR 1 -- "
  SQL

  DB.execute(sql)
end
</code></pre>

<p>What happens is the &ldquo;OR 1&rdquo; returns true and everything else after is commented out due to the double dash. So you would get back all the records in the table bunnies because your where statement has essentially been changed to &ldquo;WHERE true&rdquo; instead of actually needing a bunny&rsquo;s name and returning only the row where it finds a match. Not very secure, eh?</p>

<p>One solution to this problem is never using string interpolation. You can sanitize the data by using parameters and passing them in like so:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def so_much_bunny
  sql = &lt;&lt;-SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM bunnies
    WHERE bunnies.name = ?
  SQL

  DB.execute(sql, name)
end
</code></pre>

<p>This will escape any special characters, so if someone tried to pass in &ldquo; OR 1 &ndash;, the quote would get escaped and treated like a part of the string rather than a closing of the name query.</p>

<p>In rails, the correct form would look something like this
<code>ruby
Bunny.where("name = ?", params[:name])
</code></p>

<p>Moving on, our second point of discussion is mass assignment in rails. Mass assignment is extremely useful as it allows you to create a new instance of a class and populate all it&rsquo;s fields by just passing in a hash. So instead of doing this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">@bunny = Bunny.new
@bunny.name = "Margaret"
@bunny.status = "Happy"
@bunny.weight = "Heavy"
@bunny.color = "Brown"
@bunny.age = 2
</code></pre>

<p>you can just pass in a hash called bunny_params that holds all the information</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">@bunny = Bunny.new(bunny_params)
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, with mass assignment, it&rsquo;s possible to have a user change an attribute you don&rsquo;t want them to touch. Let&rsquo;s say we had an attribute &ldquo;free_bunnies&rdquo; that was set to a default boolean of false, and we don&rsquo;t want users to willy nilly have the ability to free all the bunnies. Using mass assignment with no limitations, they very well can.</p>

<p>For example, if you had a form to create bunnies, that contained fields for name, status, weight, etc, but not a field for free_bunnies since you don&rsquo;t want the user changing it, it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">&lt;%= form_for(@bunny) do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
      &lt;%= f.label :name %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;%= f.text_field :name %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="field"&gt;
      &lt;%= f.label :status %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;%= f.text_field :status %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="field"&gt;
      &lt;%= f.label :weight %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;%= f.text_field :weight %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>without any limitations, the user can change the form easily in their browser to pass free_bunnies to params instead of name and set the value to true and it would be passed through when creating a new bunny. So the original html would look like this
<code>html
&lt;input type="text" name="bunny[name]" id="bunny_name"&gt;
</code>
and the fanagled one would look like this
<code>html
&lt;input type="text" name="bunny[free_bunnies]" id="bunny_free_bunnies"&gt;
</code></p>

<p>The solution here, or at least one solution, is something called strong parameters. Essentially, you have to whitelist the attributes you want to allow, otherwise they will get passed into the params hash but will be &ldquo;kicked out&rdquo; and not allowed when you create your new object and you&rsquo;ll get an error saying &ldquo;Unpermitted parameters: x, y, z&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Back in Rails 3, you used to have to require a strong params gem, but now in the current version of Rails it&rsquo;s built in. When you generate a scaffold (for bunnies in this case) with the associated fields, you will automatically get some lines that look like this</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">    # Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
    def bunny_params
      params.require(:bunny).permit(:name, :status, :weight, :color, :age)
    end
</code></pre>

<p>By default all of the fields will be permitted, you will have to set what you will or won&rsquo;t allow, and that&rsquo;s that!</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m still no expert in the nefarious ways which people can use code, so enlighten me! What are the worst things you can think of to do if someone failed to account for malicious sql injections or accidentally whitelisted a param that they didn&rsquo;t mean to?</p>

    <id>http://summermin.github.io/blog/2015/04/22/a-conversation-about-abstraction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, rather than an educational presentation, I wanted to have an open dialogue about abstraction when we write code. What is it? Why is it great? Is it ever bad?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/Cornelis_Kick_01.jpg" width="350" height="500">
<img class="right" src="/images/Fick_0014-_Abstract_Flowers.jpg" width="350" height="500"></p>

<p>First of all, what exactly is abstraction? I would define it as the removal of details so that whatever thing it is we&rsquo;re abstracting moves farther and farther away from the literal representation of itself. Abstraction is wonderful for programmers because it allows us to create dynamic code that can be used and reused again without having to actually type out every line each time. The best way for me to describe it would be with some examples.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take this series of methods from a lab we did in class the other day:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def build_artists_index
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(rendered_path + "/artists")

  template = File.read("./app/views/artists/index.html.erb")
  page = ERB.new(template).result(binding)
  File.write("#{rendered_path}/artists/index.html", page)
end

def build_genres_index
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(rendered_path + "/genres")

  template = File.read("./app/views/genres/index.html.erb")
  page = ERB.new(template).result(binding)
  File.write("#{rendered_path}/genres/index.html", page)
end

def build_songs_index
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(rendered_path + "/songs")

  template = File.read("./app/views/songs/index.html.erb")
  page = ERB.new(template).result(binding)
  File.write("#{rendered_path}/songs/index.html", page)
end
</code></pre>

<p>These are pretty much all the same method except for one part of the path so we can abstract it by creating another method which all of these methods can call, so we only have to type those four lines of code once. Like this:
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>There are ways to abstract this further so we only have to call the method once instead of three times, but I don&rsquo;t want to confuse you too much.</p>

<p>Another example which we (at the Flatiron School!) have been working with lately is ActiveRecord. It&rsquo;s an extremely useful class which wraps up a whole bunch of methods for you (so you don&rsquo;t have to write them yourself, you can simply reap their benefits by calling them) to make extracting, creating, and persisting data to a database very easy. It writes all your sql statements for you, so you can continue working blissfully with ruby.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear how powerful abstraction can be. I helps us be more efficient, less redundant, and make beautiful code. However, something I have been pondering lately is this: is there ever a point in which we have abstracted something too much? I would say yes. Let&rsquo;s look at those flowers up top. Now draw a line on a piece of paper. I&rsquo;m telling you now that the line you just drew is an abstract flower. What do you think? That&rsquo;s stupid isn&rsquo;t it? Because it&rsquo;s unrecognizable. It looks like nothing in particular, but it&rsquo;s actually an abstract flower, you just can&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p>Now, over-abstracting code isn&rsquo;t as simple as that, but if you wrote some super clever and abstract code, then look back at it a month later and have no clue how it&rsquo;s actually working, I might consider it a little too abstract. That being said, I also think it depends on how experienced you and the people around you are. Take someone like me, at this point in my programming education, I need most things to be on the explicit side, but five years in, I&rsquo;ll probably be writing two lines of Ruby in what takes me 50 lines to do now, but as long as I (and the people I work with) can still understand its functions, I say: abstract away.</p>

    <link href="http://summermin.github.io/blog/2015/04/09/class-schmass/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-09T19:43:38-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://summermin.github.io/blog/2015/04/09/class-schmass</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nine days into my programming education, I am realizing 1. I know jack shit and 2. I am certainly not as clever as I thought. So an approporiate first post would be on a topic which has been challenging me lately: Ruby classes. Let&rsquo;s dive right in shall we?</p>

<p>When you strip Ruby down to its bare bones, I find that it consists simply of two things: objects and methods. Almost everything in ruby is an object (the number 1, the word &ldquo;hello&rdquo;) and methods are what you can do to those objects.</p>

<p>For example, you can tell ruby to reverse your name (your name being the object and reverse being the method). It would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">"Summer".reverse
=&gt; "remmuS" 
</code></pre>

<p>See? my name in reverse! Cool, huh? But you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;Summer, I thought we were going to talk about classes? GIVE ME CLASSES.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alright, alright, no need to get all frothy-mouthed. I&rsquo;m getting there.</p>

<p>Every object in ruby belongs to a specific class. You can check what class it is by simply calling &ldquo;.class&rdquo; on an object, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">"Summer".class
=&gt; String 

1.class
=&gt; Fixnum 
</code></pre>

<p>Man, ruby is so smart. It knows that my name in quotes is a string and the number 1 is a number, or an integer, to be more specific. So why is this important? Well, what class an object is determines what methods you can call on it. Take a look here:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">1234.reverse
NoMethodError: undefined method `length' for 1234:Fixnum
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="ruby">"1234".reverse
=&gt; "4321" 
</code></pre>

<p>When you try to run reverse on an integer, ruby doesn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. If you really wanted to get 4321, you could turn that integer into a string by adding quotes around it, then the reverse method would work. So quick recap: classes are essentially the framework behind which objects are built, and as such, they determine what methods you can use on an object. Strings have their own set of methods, integers have their own set, arrays have their own set, etc etc. Alright, take a deep breath, you with me? Just one more thing and we&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>You can make your own class and define the methods which the class can use. With these custom classes, you can do some pretty powerful stuff, what kind of stuff? We&rsquo;ll leave that for another post. Here, I&rsquo;ll provide a very simple example. Let&rsquo;s make a cat class.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Cat

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def meow
    puts "meow meow"
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>To make an instance of this class (aka, an object), you do this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">newcat = Cat.new("Olivia")
</code></pre>

<p>Here we also pass this new cat object a name variable containing the name of the cat, Olivia. We can make Olivia meow by simply saying newcat.meow (which will print out &ldquo;meow meow&rdquo; to the screen) since we defined this meow method for the cat class.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">newcat.meow
</code></pre>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it for today folks. Back to the grind, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll have much more to share with you soon.</p>
